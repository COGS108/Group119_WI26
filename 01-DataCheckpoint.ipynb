    "Research Question: What is the correlation between daily time spent on algorithm-driven social media platforms (TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts) and college students' self-reported attention span, mood state, and academic productivity?

    "TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts are personalized, AI-driven short-entertainment platforms that continuously adjust to user behavior with the goal of maximizing engagement. Their recommendation systems are designed to push highly stimulating, fast-paced videos that keep users scrolling for extended periods of time. Because these platforms are now deeply integrated into the daily lives of many college students, researchers have begun examining whether frequent exposure to this type of algorithmically curated content is linked to shifts in attention, mood, and academic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a mixed-methods study of Generation Z university students in Egypt, El-Shihy found that higher levels of social media addiction were significantly associated with greater psychological stress, reduced concentration, and lower academic engagement. Survey data revealed a positive correlation between addiction scores and students’ perceptions of academic interference. In addition, qualitative responses showed consistent themes of procrastination and difficulty maintaining focus while studying. Many participants directly connected their decreased productivity to the amount of time spent on highly engaging social media platforms, suggesting that students themselves recognize a relationship between excessive use and academic disruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pan’s research on TikTok’s personalized recommendation algorithm further highlights the role of algorithmic design. Students described the platform’s content feed as extremely relevant and difficult to disengage from, often leading to extended viewing sessions and losing track of time. Participants frequently reported procrastinating more and struggling to sustain attention on demanding tasks after prolonged use. Similarly, Henrich et al. studied adolescents and young adults between ages 13 and 21 and identified associations between long-term exposure to algorithm-driven content and shifts in attention patterns as well as mood regulation. Their findings suggest that repeated engagement with rapid, personalized content may contribute to shorter attentional cycles and heightened emotional responsiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although existing research documents clear associations between social media addiction, algorithmic personalization, attention, and psychological outcomes, much of it focuses on single countries or specific age groups. There is still limited cross-regional research examining whether these relationships differ across global contexts. Our project expands on this work by directly measuring correlations between daily time spent on algorithm-driven short-form platforms and college students’ self-reported attention span, mood state, and academic productivity, while also testing whether the strength of these relationships varies across global regions.\n"

    "We hypothesize that greater daily time spent on algorithm-driven short-form platforms (TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts) will be associated with lower self-reported attention span and reduced academic productivity among college students. Drawing from prior research showing links between social media addiction and decreased concentration and engagement (El-Shihy), as well as reports of time loss and procrastination tied to algorithmic feeds (Pan), we expect to observe a statistically significant moderate negative correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also predict that increased time on these platforms will be positively correlated with negative mood indicators, such as higher stress, anxiety, or emotional dysregulation. This expectation is supported by Henrich et al., who found associations between sustained exposure to algorithm-driven content and changes in mood-related outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we anticipate that the strength of these relationships will differ across global regions, potentially reflecting cultural differences in technology use, academic expectations, and digital access patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Note for Regrading: This hypothesis was revised to address feedback regarding operational definitions and statistical thresholds. We have specified the platforms being studied (TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts), defined \"time spent\" as daily self-reported usage, clarified correlation strength using standard benchmarks (moderate = r ≈ 0.3–0.5), and grounded our predictions in cited prior research to justify expected effect sizes.]"

    "### Social Media Usage and Academic Impact Among Students\n",
    " \n",
    "**Dataset 1: \n",
    "Students Social Media Addiction and Academic Impact Dataset contains 705 observations that track the intersection of digital habits and student wellbeing. One of the primary metrics is Average Daily Usage Hours, which measures the amount of time a student spends on social media platforms each day. In the context of student health, usage exceeding 4 to 6 hours is often considered high and may correlate with decreased academic focus. Another critical metric is the Sleep Hours Per Night, measured in hours. For students, the recommended sleep duration is typically between 7 and 9 hours; values significantly lower than this may indicate that social media use is displacing essential rest, which can further impact cognitive function and classroom performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset also utilizes two subjective scales: the Mental Health Score and the Addicted Score. Both are measured on an integer scale from 1 to 10. For the Mental Health Score, a higher value represents better perceived mental wellbeing, whereas for the Addicted Score, a higher value indicates a stronger self-perceived dependency on social media platforms. Additionally, the variable Affects Academic Performance is a categorical binary measure (Yes or No). This represents the student's own assessment of whether their digital habits have hindered their schooling. These metrics allow for a multidimensional look at how digital consumption relates to both the psychological and practical aspects of a student's life.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several concerns regarding the data that should be noted. Because all metrics—including hours used and the addiction score—are self-reported, the dataset is susceptible to recall bias and social desirability bias. Students may underestimate their actual screen time or hesitate to report a high addiction score. Furthermore, the dataset includes students from various countries like Bangladesh, India, the UK, and the USA, but with a relatively small sample size of 705, the data may not be truly representative of the global student population. Finally, because the data is cross-sectional, it can show correlations between social media use and academic performance, but it cannot definitively prove that social media addiction causes lower grades."

    "### Student Social Media & Academic Performance Survey\n",
    "\n",
    "Student Social Media, Academic Performance Dataset is a survey-based dataset with 405 student responses that focus on how students' social media habits relate to academic outcomes and general wellbeing. Each row represents one student and each column represents one measured attribute from the questionare. The dataset includes a mix of demographic context variables and behavior/psychological outcome variables that describe social media behavior, along with academic and wellbeing-related outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary metric is \"Time Spent on Social Media (hours)\", which is a self-reported daily figure in which \"usage\" quantified through time spent (recorded as hours/day). However, this column has significant formatting inconsistencies with some students entering clean integers while others writing things like \"Highest 2 hour\" or \"2-3 hrs,\" which makes numerical analysis without cleaning difficult. Similarly, \"Study Time (in Hours)\" and \"Attendance Rate (in Percentile)\" have entries mixed in with plain numbers, and need to be standardized before modeling. \"Most Time Spent in a Day\" is a categorical variable with 4 options (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night) that define when during the day students are most active on social media. This is relevant since evening/night use can interfere with sleep more than daytime use. Also, the dataset records which platform students use (e.g. Tiktok, Youtube, Instagram) and whether or not they are physically active for 30+ minutes per day (Yes/No). Time-based metrics are  important since they are a direct, interpretable measure that define higher daily time spent (4+ hours) to be a greater exposure to algorithm-driven fields, which can displace study time, sleep, or attention (but doesn't imply addiction). \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset also includes metrics related to wellbeing and attention-related experiences that are all measured on ordinal 1-5 Likert scales (sleep disturbance on sleep quality, mood modification scale, anxiety scale, depression scale, self esteem scale, and social media distraction during academic activities). Higher values on the anxiety, depression, and distraction indicate worser outcomes while higher self-esteem values indicate a better perceived self worth. Withdrawal Symptoms is a categorical variable that has five response options (e.g., \"Feeling restless,\" \"Cravings,\" \"Trouble concentrating,\" \"No symptoms\"), that each convey a sense of behavioral dependency. Last Academic Result (GPA/CGPA) is an outcome variable that represents the students' academic performance, but is formatted inconsistently with decimals and letter grades. While these metrics be used for testing whether heavier short-form/algorithmic consumption is associated with poorer self-reported attention and more negative mood indicators, these metrics capture association rather than causation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since all metrics are survey-based and self reported, Respondents may underreport usage or overreport positive academic habits due to recall error and social desirability bias. Also, since the dataset appears to draw reponses primarily from Metropolitan University and related academic communities), it may not represent college students globally, which limits how confidently we can generalize findings across regions. Responses are collected at one point in time, which allows us to identify correlations (i.e. associating higher usage with lower productivity) but cannot conclude causation. Many survey items mix numeric and categorical/ordinal responses that require reprocessing and the proper determination of correlation methods for each type of data. Lastly, it is important to consider that other factors such as course load, access to devices/the internet, etc... can influence both usage and outcomes, so there is potential confounding in the dataset. \n",

    "A primary concern is the privacy paradox, where participants may share sensitive personal information without grasping the long-term implications of that data being recorded, such as precise daily routines. Because the question relies on self-reported metrics for \"mood\" and \"attention,\" there is a high risk of social desirability bias. Students may subconsciously underreport their actual screen time on apps like TikTok or overreport their academic productivity to appear more disciplined.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is also susceptible to representation bias and selection bias, particularly regarding the \"digital divide.\" The data we collect inherently excludes students who may not have access to high-speed internet or high-end smartphones capable of running these apps. Social media algorithms themselves reflect algorithmic bias, where certain content or demographics are prioritized over others. If we don't carefully balance our dataset, the conclusions might suggest that \"average\" productivity looks like a specific demographic's experience, further marginalizing students from different socioeconomic or cultural backgrounds. To address this, we will conduct a demographic audit to compare our sample's diversity against global university enrollment statistics and use stratified analysis to look for patterns within specific subgroups rather than just the aggregate \"average student.\" When communicating results, we will explicitly state the limitations of our sample and avoid making universal claims if certain populations are underrepresented.\n",

    "Collecting information related to screen usage patterns, emotional state, and daily behaviors may reveal sensitive details about individuals' lives, even when identifiers are removed. There is also a concern that data collected for a class project could later be misunderstood or used in ways it wasn't originally intended. To reduce this risk, we will only collect information that is truly necessary, avoid gathering identifying details, and make sure data is stored securely. We will also be clear with participants about why their data is being collected and how it will be used and protected. Our analysis will focus on overall trends and subgroup patterns rather than individual-level behavior, and when presenting findings, we will be careful to explain the limits of the data and avoid making broad or judgmental conclusions."

    " - Comunication and Meetings: We will primarly communicate via iMessage for quick updates and questions throughout the week while using Github for tracking code and progress. Team members are expected to respond within 24 hours on weekdays and in a timely manner when deadlines approach! We will meet atleast once to check progress and plan next steps.\n",
    " - Respect: We agree to communicate respectfully and constructively, giving reasonable feedback and understand to not criticize individuals.\n",
    " - Decision Making: Major decisions will be discussed as a group and decided by consensus/majority vote.\n",
    " - Task Distribution: Tasks will be divided based on individual strengths and interests (e.g., data wrangling, analysis, writing), but all members are expected to contribute to every major aspect of the project. We will track responsibilities and deadlines using GitHub commits and shared notes. If ussues arise, everyone should communicate early!\n",
    " - Conflict: If a team member is struggling with a task, they should let the others know asap to redistribute tasks."
