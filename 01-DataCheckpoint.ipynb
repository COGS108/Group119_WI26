    "Research Question: What is the correlation between daily time spent on algorithm-driven social media platforms (TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts) and college students' self-reported attention span, mood state, and academic productivity?

    "TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts are personalized, AI-driven short-entertainment platforms that continuously adjust to user behavior with the goal of maximizing engagement. Their recommendation systems are designed to push highly stimulating, fast-paced videos that keep users scrolling for extended periods of time. Because these platforms are now deeply integrated into the daily lives of many college students, researchers have begun examining whether frequent exposure to this type of algorithmically curated content is linked to shifts in attention, mood, and academic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a mixed-methods study of Generation Z university students in Egypt, El-Shihy found that higher levels of social media addiction were significantly associated with greater psychological stress, reduced concentration, and lower academic engagement. Survey data revealed a positive correlation between addiction scores and students’ perceptions of academic interference. In addition, qualitative responses showed consistent themes of procrastination and difficulty maintaining focus while studying. Many participants directly connected their decreased productivity to the amount of time spent on highly engaging social media platforms, suggesting that students themselves recognize a relationship between excessive use and academic disruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pan’s research on TikTok’s personalized recommendation algorithm further highlights the role of algorithmic design. Students described the platform’s content feed as extremely relevant and difficult to disengage from, often leading to extended viewing sessions and losing track of time. Participants frequently reported procrastinating more and struggling to sustain attention on demanding tasks after prolonged use. Similarly, Henrich et al. studied adolescents and young adults between ages 13 and 21 and identified associations between long-term exposure to algorithm-driven content and shifts in attention patterns as well as mood regulation. Their findings suggest that repeated engagement with rapid, personalized content may contribute to shorter attentional cycles and heightened emotional responsiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although existing research documents clear associations between social media addiction, algorithmic personalization, attention, and psychological outcomes, much of it focuses on single countries or specific age groups. There is still limited cross-regional research examining whether these relationships differ across global contexts. Our project expands on this work by directly measuring correlations between daily time spent on algorithm-driven short-form platforms and college students’ self-reported attention span, mood state, and academic productivity, while also testing whether the strength of these relationships varies across global regions.\n"

    "We hypothesize that greater daily time spent on algorithm-driven short-form platforms (TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts) will be associated with lower self-reported attention span and reduced academic productivity among college students. Drawing from prior research showing links between social media addiction and decreased concentration and engagement (El-Shihy), as well as reports of time loss and procrastination tied to algorithmic feeds (Pan), we expect to observe a statistically significant moderate negative correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also predict that increased time on these platforms will be positively correlated with negative mood indicators, such as higher stress, anxiety, or emotional dysregulation. This expectation is supported by Henrich et al., who found associations between sustained exposure to algorithm-driven content and changes in mood-related outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we anticipate that the strength of these relationships will differ across global regions, potentially reflecting cultural differences in technology use, academic expectations, and digital access patterns.\n"

    "      - The sample only includes students between the ages of 16 and 25, which limits how well the findings generalize to older adults or non-student populations.\n",
    "      - If the survey was distributed online or completed voluntarily, it may be affected by self-selection bias, meaning the students who chose to participate may not represent the broader student population.\n",

    "Instructions: \n",
    "1. Change the header from Dataset #1 to something more descriptive of the dataset\n",
    "2. Write a few paragraphs about this dataset. Make sure to cover\n",
    "   1. Describe the important metrics, what units they are in, and giv some sense of what they mean.  For example \"Fasting blood glucose in units of mg glucose per deciliter of blood.  Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset 1: \n",
    "Students Social Media Addiction and Academic Impact Dataset contains 705 observations that track the intersection of digital habits and student wellbeing. One of the primary metrics is Average Daily Usage Hours, which measures the amount of time a student spends on social media platforms each day. In the context of student health, usage exceeding 4 to 6 hours is often considered high and may correlate with decreased academic focus. Another critical metric is the Sleep Hours Per Night, measured in hours. For students, the recommended sleep duration is typically between 7 and 9 hours; values significantly lower than this may indicate that social media use is displacing essential rest, which can further impact cognitive function and classroom performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset also utilizes two subjective scales: the Mental Health Score and the Addicted Score. Both are measured on an integer scale from 1 to 10. For the Mental Health Score, a higher value represents better perceived mental wellbeing, whereas for the Addicted Score, a higher value indicates a stronger self-perceived dependency on social media platforms. Additionally, the variable Affects Academic Performance is a categorical binary measure (Yes or No). This represents the student's own assessment of whether their digital habits have hindered their schooling. These metrics allow for a multidimensional look at how digital consumption relates to both the psychological and practical aspects of a student's life.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several concerns regarding the data that should be noted. Because all metrics—including hours used and the addiction score—are self-reported, the dataset is susceptible to recall bias and social desirability bias. Students may underestimate their actual screen time or hesitate to report a high addiction score. Furthermore, the dataset includes students from various countries like Bangladesh, India, the UK, and the USA, but with a relatively small sample size of 705, the data may not be truly representative of the global student population. Finally, because the data is cross-sectional, it can show correlations between social media use and academic performance, but it cannot definitively prove that social media addiction causes lower grades.**\n",
